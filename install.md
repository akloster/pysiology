Installation
=====

Currently this package is not ready for distribution, and you will have to do some fiddling to make it work for you.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.5
- pybluez (you will need libbluetooth-dev)
- aiohttp
- akloster/nb-assets
- akloster/table-cleaner
- recent Bokeh

For the presentation I used the IPython version distributed with the Python 3.4 anaconda distribution.

To run the data server, run the server.py script. You have to change the address in the file to your Mindwave's bluetooth address.
